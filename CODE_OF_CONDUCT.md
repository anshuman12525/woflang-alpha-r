Code of Conduct

The WofLang Alpha-R project (C++ v10.1.1 and Rust v0.0.1) is a space for creative, symbolic, and experimental computing. To keep it welcoming and safe for everyone:



Our Expectations

All contributors and community members are expected to:



Be respectful, patient, and professional in all interactions.



Focus on ideas, code, and design—not individuals or identities.



Avoid any form of harassment, hate speech, or discrimination.



Use inclusive language and assume good intent where possible.



Welcome newcomers and help them navigate WofLang’s unique concepts.



Keep discussions on-topic for WofLang and related technologies.



Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of behavior that will not be tolerated include:



Harassment, threats, or personal attacks.



Discriminatory language or exclusionary jokes.



Unwanted attention or disruptive behavior in issues, PRs, or discussions.



Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.



Persistent antagonism after being asked to stop.



Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:



All project spaces: GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and code review.



Any public spaces where you represent the project or its community.



Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:



Contact the maintainer privately (via GitHub profile or issue escalation).



Clearly describe what happened, where, and who was involved.



Include links, screenshots, or logs if you can do so safely.



Reports will be reviewed in good faith and handled as discreetly as possible.



Enforcement

The maintainer may take any action deemed appropriate, including:



Warning the offender.



Editing, locking, or removing comments, issues, or pull requests.



Temporarily or permanently banning participation from the project.



Repeated or severe violations will result in stronger enforcement.



This policy is inspired by the spirit of the Contributor Covenant.
